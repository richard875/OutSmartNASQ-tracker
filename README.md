- New York uses Eastern Standard Time (EST, UTC -5) and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT, UTC -4)
- The project uses `moment.js` to avoid errors
- All time within the project will be based on time zone of New York State

<br/>

## Holidays and market hours

- Both **NYSE** and **NASDAQ** shares the same holidays and trading hours (9:30 am - 4:00 pm | Mon - Fri)
- Pre / Post market is **ignored** (Data is still been calculated, but no trading will happen)
- This project will use [NASDAQ's data](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=Calendar) for halfdays and holidays
